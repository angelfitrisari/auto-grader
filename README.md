# Auto-Grader
SE Auto Grader Project

Brief Background about the Auto-Grader Web Service: 
Efficiency and convention are very important factors in programming. 
However, the existing programming education platform does not automatically score or provide feedback in the relevant parts. 
This can become an issue because this can be misleading, and students might have difficulties trying to understand their own abilities and level in coding. 
Therefore, this project aims to provide  a  system  that  provides  evaluation  results  for  efficiency  and  convention  for  students'  code.  
Through  this,  students  can  objectively  know  their  programming  skills  from  various  aspects. 

1. This is the main (home) page of the website. This page consists of the slogan and a few simplistic designs and logo, along with short descriptions
and buttons for user to log in or create and account.

2. This is the Log In page. User can log in with the account that they have registered in the register page.

3. This is the Register page. User can create an account here.

4. This is the Assignment page (dashboard). User can access which lessons they are going to check their programming codes with.

5. This is the Coding Page. Users can input their codes here to have them checked by the website. 
On the left side is the assignment description and the test case on the bottom. The right side is the result field where the algorithm will grade the code input.
The result field has two tabs, the first one will provide the user with an overall score and the second tab will provide the user with a more detailed explanation.
The detailed explanation shows:
1) Cognitive Complexity. Cognitive complexity measures how difficult it is to understand the code.
2) LOC. Measures the lines of code it has. 
3) Halstead Volume. Measures the size of an algorithm, the vocabulary of the code input. 
4) Cyclomatic Complexity. Measures the control flow of the program, the complexity of the code input itself. 

These algorithms were made with the help of multiple python libraries such as Multimetric and Pylint.
